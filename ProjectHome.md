The self-organizing map is a popular unsupervised neural network model for high-dimensional data analysis. However, the high execution times required to train the map put a limit to its use in many application domains, where either very large datasets are encountered and/or real-time response times are required.

Project is host for implementation of a parallel algorithm, purpose of which is to significantly improve calculations of standard algorithm. This is main goal of actual project.

This project represents Andriy Buday's Master Diploma work.
